# I love project Euler!

## Why make a repository of this?
I am learning javascript for my new job, so I have been doing Euler problems for a few weeks now. 
That wouldn't cause me to make a repo for it though. There was a loss in my family. A poor hard drive just couldn't take 
is rotary lifestyle anymore, and it killed itself. Along with all my Euler code. Silly me, didn't back it up.(I know better)
